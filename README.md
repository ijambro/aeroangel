## About

🛫 **[flyExclusive](https://www.flyexclusive.com)** is a North Carolina-based airline for private and charter jets.

👼 **[AeroAngel](https://www.aeroangel.org)** is a non-profit that coordinates life-saving flights for children needing distant medical treatment.

📲 I'm creating a **React Native App** to help **AeroAngel** coordinate flight requests with **flyExclusive** and other charter jet providers.
